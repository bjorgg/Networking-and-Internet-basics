# Networking and Internet basics

This is a school project, an article about networking and Internet basics. I did a quick overview of networking and Internet basics with explanatory images. I didn't go deep into each subject but hopefully, this sums it up nicely.
I didn't comment the code because it's not relevant and not much there.
