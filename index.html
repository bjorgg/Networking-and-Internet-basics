        <h1>– Linux navigation –</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is my first time navigating a Linux system so I can't teach you everything you need to know 
            to use it effectively. I'm just going to try out some basic terminal commands and file 
            manipulation and share that with you.
        <br>
        <br>
            There are a lot of Linux distrubutions out there, I chose to install the latest LTS version of 
            Ubuntu via Virtual Box. I will not go into details about the installation here, you can find 
            many tutorials about that online if you haven't done that already. So lets open up the terminal and get started!</p><br>
            <br>
        
        <h2>Basic navigation</h2>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Print working directory - <code>pwd</code></h3>
        <p>Shows the current directory you are in. If you have just started your system it's most likely 
            your user account's home directory.</p>
<pre>
$ pwd
/home/yourusername</pre>
        <br>
        
        <h3>List - <code>ls</code></h3>
        <p>Lists all the content inside the directory. It's possible to add some optional flags to the 
            command to modify the default behavior.</p>
<pre>
$ ls 
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos</pre>
        <p>It's is also possible to use <code>tree</code> command to get more fancy visualization. I had to 
            install it first, the terminal gave me directions on how to do that.</p>
<pre>
$ tree
<img src="images/tree.png" alt="tree"></pre>
<br>
        
        <h3>Change directory - <code>cd</code></h3>
        <p>This is the most basic command line there is. The directory changes according to what you type 
            after <code>cd</code>. You can give an absolute path or a relative path which refers to a directory 
            within the current directory. Typing <code>cd</code> alone will bring you to the home directory 
            of the user. <code>cd -</code> will bring you to the recent directory you were in. <code>cd ..</code> 
            will bring you to the parent directory of the directory you are in.</p>
<pre>
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/home/yourusername/Documents

$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/yourusername

$ cd - 
/home/yourusername/Documents</pre>
<br>
        <h2>File manipulation</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Make directory - <code>mkdir</code></h3>
        <p>This command is used to create empty directories. After <code>mkdir</code> you write the name of 
            the directory you want to create an it's created in the current directory. To create any 
            directories necessary to construct a given directory path, you can use the <code>-p</code> option. This 
            allows you to create nested directories in one step.</p>
<pre>
$ mkdir demo
$ ls
demo

$ mkdir -p demo2/test
$ ls
demo  demo2

$ cd demo2
$ ls
test</pre>
<br>

        <h3>Create a file - <code>touch</code></h3>
        <p>This command creates an empty file. After <code>touch</code> you write the name of the file 
            you want to create and it's created in the current directory. It's also possible to use an 
            absolute path to choose another directory.</p>
<pre>
$ cd
$ touch file1
$ ls
file1

$ touch /home/yourusername/file2
$ ls
file1  file2</pre>
<br>

        <h3>Move - <code>mv</code></h3>
        <p>This command is used to move files. It can also be used to rename files and directories. 
            When using <code>mv</code> to rename you have to remember that Linux system will not 
            prevent you from certain destructive actions. If you choose a name that exists already the 
            previous file will be overwritten and there is no way to recover it.</p>
<pre>
$ mv file1 Documents
$ ls Documents
file1

$ cd Documents
$ mv file1 newname
$ ls 
newname</pre>
<br>

        <h3>Remove - <code>rm</code></h3>
        <p>This command removes files. If you want to remove directories you can use <code>rmdir</code>, 
            this can only be used with empty directories. if you want to remove a non-empty directory you 
            can use <code>rm -r</code>, this will remove all of the directory's content and the directory 
            it self. These actions cannot be undone.</p>
<pre>
$ rm newname

$ rmdir demo

$ rm -r demo2</pre>
<br>

        <h3>Copy - <code>cp</code></h3>
        <p>This command copies files. If you want to copy directories you can use <code>cp -r</code>. 
            Note that as with the <code>mv</code> command it's possible to overwrite files if you 
            choose a name that already exists.</p>
<pre>
$ cp newname newname2
$ ls
newname  newname2</pre>
<br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I had alot of fun trying out the Linux system. There are alot of commands I still have 
            to try out but I won't cover more here, this could then go on forever. Below is a link 
            to a Unix/Linux command line cheet sheet for you to check out, good luck! <br>
